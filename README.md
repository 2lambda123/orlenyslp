# Caterpillar
BPMN execution engine on Ethereum

Caterpillar is a Business Process Management System (BPMS) that runs on top of Ethereum and that relies on the translation of process models into smart contracts. More specifically, Caterpillar accepts as input a process model specified in BPMN and generates a set of smart contracts that captures the underlying behavior. The smart contracts, written in Ethereum's Solidity language, can then be compiled and deployed to the public or any other private Ethereum network using standard tools. Moreover, Caterpillar exhibits a REST API that can be used to interact with running instances of the deployed process models.

Caterpillar also provides a set of modelling tools and an execution panel which interact with the underlying execution engine via the aforementioned REST API. The latter can also be used by third party software to interact in a programmatic way via Caterpillar with the instances of business process running on the blockchain.

Caterpillarâ€™s code distribution in this repository contains three different folders. 
The folder caterpillar_core includes the implementation of the core components, execution_panel includes the code of a BPMN visualizer that serves to keep track of the execution state of process instances and to lets users check in process data, and services_manager contains the implementation for an external service used for demonstration purposes.

Before using the Caterpillar it is necessary to download the source code of the applications.

## Installing testrpc

For running Caterillar locally in your computer it is required to install testrpc which is a Node.js based Ethereum client for testing and development. It uses ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications. All the instructions about the installation can be found here: https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc.

> Please, be aware to start the testrpc server before running the applications Caterpillar Core and Services Manager. In that respect, you only need to open a terminal on your computer and run the command:

     testrpc

## How to use Caterpillar Core

Open a terminal in your computer and move into the folder __caterpillar_core__. 

For installing the dependencies, run the comands 

     npm install
     gulp build

For running the application you use one of the following comands
 
     node ./out/www.js     
     
> If the process model has service tasks and consequently needs to interact with the services manager application, then you must run the services manager application and create the corresponding services before running Caterpillar core.

By default the application will runs on http://localhost:3000.

The application provides a REST API to interact with the core of Caterpillar. The following table summarizes the mapping of resource-related actions:

| Verb | URI                       | Description                                                            |
| -----| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST | /models                   | Registers a BPMN model (Triggers also code generation and compilation) |
| GET  | /models                   | Retrieves the list of registered BPMN models                           |
| GET  | /models/:mid              | Retrieves a BPMN model and its compilation artifacts                   |
| POST | /models/:mid              | Creates a new process instance from a given model                      |
| GET  | /processes/               | Retrieves the list of active process instances                         |
| GET  | /processes/:pid           | Retrieves the current state of a process instance                      |
| POST | /workitems/:wimid/:wiid   | Checks-in a work item (i.e. user task)                                 |
| POST | /workitems/:wimid/:evname | Forwards message event, delivered only if the event is enabled         |

From the caterpillar_core folder is possible to run the script

     node demo_running_example_test.js
     
to register, create an instance and get the address of a sample process provided in the file __demo_running_example.bpmn__. For running the sample process it is also required to run first the application __services_manager__ and to register the external services.

## How to use Services Manager

Open a terminal in your computer and move into the folder __services_manager__. 

For installing the dependencies, run the comand 

     npm install
     gulp build

For running the application use the comand 

     node ./out/www.js

By default the application will runs on http://localhost:3010.

The application provides a REST API to interact with services manager. The following table summarizes the mapping of resource-related actions:

| Verb | URI            | Description                                                            |
| -----| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST | /services      | Registers an external service                                          |
| GET  | /services      | Retrieves the list of registered external services                     |
| GET  | /services/:sid | Retrieves smart contract/address of an external service                |

From the __services_manager__ folder is possible to run the script

     node oracle_creation.js

to register the services required by the running example provided in the core.

## How to use Execution Panel

Open a terminal in your computer and move into the folder __execution-panel__. 

For installing the dependencies, run the comand 

     npm install

For running the application use the comand 

     ng serve
     
Open a web browser and put the URL http://localhost:4200/.

You must use the button refresh to update the instances running, and then select one of the URLs obtained that will contain the address when it is running the smart contract. Then press the button __Open__. Here, you can see the enabled activities visualized in dark green. For executing any enabled activity, just click on it and fill the parameter info if required. All the execution of the process (including internal operations) can be traced from the terminals of __caterpillar_core__ and __services_manager__.


## Running Caterpillar from a Docker Image

The running example provided in the core can be executed from a Docked Image by executing the command:

     docker run --rm -it -p 3200:3200 -p 3000:3000 -p 8090:8090 orlenyslp/caterpillar-demo:v1

> Note that first, you need to install Docker (https://www.docker.com/) in your computer.

First, you will see in the terminal, the creation of the required services, followed by the generation, compilation and deployment of the smart contracts. Then, when you be able to see the message CONTRACT CREATED!!! AT ADDRESS: ... in the terminal, you can open a web browser to interact with execution panel that will be running in the URL http://localhost:3200/.
